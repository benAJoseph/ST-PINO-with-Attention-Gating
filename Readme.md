# Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Neural Operator (ST-PINO)

## Overview
Landslides are complex natural disasters influenced by multiple factors. Traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost have shown promise but lack physics-based reasoning. This project introduces **Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Neural Operator (ST-PINO)** with **Attention Gating**, a novel approach that integrates physics constraints with deep learning for enhanced predictive performance.

## Features
- **Hybrid AI Framework**: Combines physics-based constraints with machine learning.
- **Attention Gating Mechanism**: Dynamically balances physical stability and observed patterns.
- **Multi-Expert Approach**: Incorporates hydrological, geotechnical, and human activity insights.
- **Real-World Application**: Evaluated against traditional models for improved accuracy.
